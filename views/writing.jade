    h1 Writing
  p.
    Sometimes I feel inspired to do some writing.  The following are years of writing done in two short bursts
    separated by a decade. At the time I thought of them as songs with a chorus (italics), but they read like poems as
    well. Feel free to interpret them how you prefer.

      h2 A New Horizon
      p.
        I wrote this collection during the second half of 2008 while finishing a fall semester of C.S. at SF State.

                  p I lie and grin trying to find myself again
                  p Lost and insecure, committing varied sins
                  p Always trying to be something I'm not
                  p Dream and scheme, fabricate a plot

                  p Tortured by a long transition
                  p How did I get in this position
                  p I'm a fast thinker who anticipates
                  p Preempt the conversation on every date
                .verse
                  p I can hardly believe this is me
                  p My future's uncertain and in jeopardy
                  p Where do you turn when there's nowhere to hide
                  p I feign instead of face the pain inside
                .chorus
                  p I'm shell-shocked torn and surprised
                  p For my transgressions I indemnify
                  p Underachiever turned believer in my life
                  p The future changes for me tonight!
