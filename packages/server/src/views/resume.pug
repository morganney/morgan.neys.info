            ul
              li Utilizing Yarn Workspaces I started a mono-repo for development of standalone SPAs, micro-frontends, a shared React component library, and an Express mock server.
              li Created a React component that made use of dynamic imports to lazy load different micro-frontends into an integrated web app.
              li Transitioned an OAuth 2 flow for an SPA away from the browser and into a Node/Typescript backend-for-frontend based on the <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps-07#section-6.2'>IETF BCP</a>.
              li Developed features for React applications using Typescript, Redux, Styled Components, Jest, and Enzyme/Testing Library.
